### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1 was a favorite because it was the first lab that I did. This lab was also a favorite because it was my first time coding. In this lab I was able to learn the basic commands which laid the groundwork for other labs where the commands where gonna be used.


* Lab 6

    Lab 6 part 2 was a favorite because I was able to learn how the game BlackJack works. I was able to learn how to calculate the value. I was also able to learn how to implment other functions into a file.



* Lab 8

    Lab 8 part 1 was a favorite because it was fun to see how many different sandwich combinations you were able to make. I learned what vectors are and how to use them, what they are used for, and how useful they are.
